# Black Tea

As with all “true teas,” black tea is derived from the Camellia sinensis plant. Leaves of the plant are crushed, curled, rolled, or torn and then left to oxidize before they’re dried and sold.

# Benefits of Black Tea
Black tea is steadily attracting more and more attention from researchers. While studies are still ongoing, so far research suggests black tea may:

- Support heart health
- Help support the body’s protection against oxidative stress (which happens when damaging free radicals are left unchecked in the body)
