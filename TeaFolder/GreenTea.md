# Green Tea

Green tea is prepared from the fresh or withered, lightly heated or steamed leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant.
This preparation stops the oxidation process and accounts for green tea’s flavor profile, which is best described as light, fresh, and maybe slightly grassy.

# Benefits of Green Tea
Green tea is the most heavily studied type of “true” tea, and research into this brew is overwhelmingly positive. So far, research suggests green tea may:

- Support mental alertness and acuity (thanks to its caffeine content)
- Support heart health
- Help support the body’s natural protection against oxidative stress
- Support brain health
- Green tea is also a great tea to help support fasting.
