# White Tea

White tea is created from new buds and young leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, 
which helps explain why it has the most delicate flavor profile of all the “true” teas. 

# Different types of white tea include:

- Bai Hao Yin Zhen (aka Silver Needle), which is a rare tea made only from buds. It has a floral scent and sweet flavor.

- Bai Mu Dan (aka White Peony), which has a slightly stronger flavor than Silver Needle thanks to the inclusion of young leaves as well as buds.
- Darjeeling White tea, which is grown in India and is usually less expensive than white teas grown in Yunnan.

- Gong Mei (aka Tribute Eyebrow), which is derived from more mature leaves and has a richer, earthier flavor than most other styles of white tea.

# Benefits of White Tea
Because it’s minimally processed, white tea is thought to have especially high levels of good-for-you catechins. 
It also boasts plenty of other health benefits:

- It has antioxidant properties, meaning it can potentially help protect against oxidative stress
- It may help support the body’s response to inflammation
- It may help support dental health thanks to the fact that it contains fluoride, catechins, and tannins. Fluoride is known to support teeth strength, 
- while catechins and tannins may support the management of plaque bacteria in the mouth
- It may help support brain health
