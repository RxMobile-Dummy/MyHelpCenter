# White Tea

White tea is created from new buds and young leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, 
which helps explain why it has the most delicate flavor profile of all the “true” teas. 

# Different types of white tea include:

Bai Hao Yin Zhen (aka Silver Needle) | Bai Mu Dan (aka White Peony) | Darjeeling White tea | Gong Mei (aka Tribute Eyebrow)

# Benefits of White Tea
Because it’s minimally processed, white tea is thought to have especially high levels of good-for-you catechins. 
It also boasts plenty of other health benefits:

- It has antioxidant properties, meaning it can potentially help protect against oxidative stress
- It may help support the body’s response to inflammation
- It may help support dental health thanks to the fact that it contains fluoride, catechins, and tannins. Fluoride is known to support teeth strength, 
- while catechins and tannins may support the management of plaque bacteria in the mouth
- It may help support brain health
